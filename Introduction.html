                Due to COVID-19 MMA club has been suspended because of mask requirements at UREC, I get a lot of emails and people asking me if
                the club is resuming. I have to be the bearer of bad news telling them that it will not until masks mandates are over. Even with
                my mask covering my face on campus, people still recognize me and approach me with this question, I kind of feel like a celebrity.
